# my_steam_app

This web app is meant to be helpful when you don't know what to play on Steam.

It will randomly pick a game from Steam public library and propose it to you: beware it can be everything, including DLC and bundles, no filters applied.

It is a hobby project that I am using to learn a little bit about NodeJS and web deployment.
